Merge PDF is a free online tool to merge multiple PDF files into one PDF file.

You can merge PDF files by selecting them one by one or by drag and drop. You can also add more PDFs to combine them and merge them into one single document.
No installation, no registration, it's free and easy to use.

Merging PDF files is the process of combining two or more PDF documents into a single PDF file. This is done by taking the pages from each individual PDF and putting them together in a new document.

Imagine you have several separate papers that you want to combine into one big file. Merging PDFs is like stapling those papers together so they become one complete document. It's useful when you have multiple PDF files that relate to the same subject or project, and you want to keep them together for easier organization or sharing with others.
