Image tools are designed to help you with image processing.
They can be used to extract, copy, and paste images from documents.
They can also be used to convert images from one format to another.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList'
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common'

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
