Compress PNG Images Online is a free online tool to compress PNG without losing quality and minimize
the size of PNG.

A compress PNG tool is a software program or online service that is specifically designed to compress PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files. PNG files are commonly used for graphics and icons on websites, but they can be large in size and take longer to load.

A compress PNG tool uses various techniques to reduce the file size of PNG images, such as removing unnecessary metadata, reducing the color depth, or applying lossless compression algorithms that compress the data without losing any image quality.

Compressing PNG images is especially important for website designers and developers, as it can help to speed up the loading time of web pages, which is important for user experience and search engine optimization. It also helps to save storage space, which is important when dealing with a large number of images or limited storage space.
