Using an SVG to PNG converter has several advantages, such as the ability to quickly convert multiple SVG files to PNG format, the ability to customize the output settings such as the size and resolution of the PNG image, and the convenience of being able to perform the conversion online without installing any software. Overall, SVG to PNG conversion is a useful tool for anyone who needs to convert vector images to raster format for web or print purposes.
